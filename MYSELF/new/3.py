sentence = "The environment is the natural world around an organism that allows it to survive. The French word environment, which means to surround is derived from the English word environment. It is made up of living creatures like plants, animals, and human beings. The non-living elements of the environment are air, water, and land. Nature has designed its functioning in such a way that everything is interdependent. The human beings are the most powerful of all the creatures that rely on and make use of the earths natural resources. Air is required for the survival of not just humans, but also plants and animals. Without air, there will be no life on Earth. Human beings alone are responsible for the degradation of the environment. The atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere are the different layers that make up the environment. Several gases, like oxygen and nitrogen, make up the atmosphere. The hydrosphere is made up of different water bodies like rivers, oceans, seas, etc. The lithosphere is the earthâ€™s outermost layer, which is made up of rock and soil. The biosphere is home to all living beings. The environment is influenced by a variety of elements; some are natural, and others are man-made. Global challenges such as global warming and wars have a negative impact on our environment and surroundings."
